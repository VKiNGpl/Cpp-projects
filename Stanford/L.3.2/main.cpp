---------------
This program plays casino game called craps, which is
played using a pair of dice. At the beginning of the game,
you roll the dice and compute the total. If your first roll
is 7 or 11, you winn with what gamblers call a "natural."
If your first roll is 2, 3, or 12, you lose by "crapping
out." In any other case, the total from the first roll
becomes your "point," after which you continue to roll
the dice until one of the following conditions occurs:

a)  You roll a point again. This is called "making
    your point," which wins.

b)  You roll a 7, which loses.

Other rolls, including 2, 3, 11, 12, have on effect
during this phase of the game.
